## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I did not even know what accordion is :-D 
I tried to use SASS in my coding for the very first time.
I really struggled (and was definitely not completely successful) with positioning of the images. 

### Useful resources

- [Accordion tutorial on freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-an-accordion-menu-using-html-css-and-javascript/) - This helped me to realize what an accordion is and how it should work.
- [Sass documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation)
